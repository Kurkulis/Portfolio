            "I am Ignas Kurkulis ‚Äì a motivated and curious individual, building my experience across various fields ‚Äì from volunteering for youth communities and serving in the military to business management, aviation company operations, and most importantly, programming.",
            "During my school years, I was actively involved in the youth organization ‚ÄûApskritasis stalas‚Äú, where I coordinated camps, helped organize city festivals, planned youth activities, and hosted various events.",
            "After graduating from high school, I completed a 9-month voluntary military service in the Lithuanian Armed Forces, at the Duke Vaidotas Infantry Battalion. During my service, I was promoted in military rank for performing my duties effectively and responsibly.",
            "Upon completing the mentioned voluntary service, I enrolled at Vilnius University Business School. I chose to study International Business, during which I completed an internship at the Human Resources Department of ‚ÄúHeston Airlines‚Äù. Additionally, while studying, I worked as a Crew Coordinator in the aviation industry for 3 years, where I gained valuable experience. The most important takeaway was getting to know the internal operational processes of the aviation sector.",
            "After graduating, I started actively exploring the IT field and chose to focus on Full-Stack development. Currently, I am studying in the JavaScript Full-Stack long-term program at Vilnius Coding School. This training is a great introduction to the programming industry, and my next step is to deepen my knowledge, continue learning, and challenge myself in personal IT projects.",
            "I am eager and aim to sharpen my skills in a dynamic and challenging environment. I guarantee enthusiasm in my work and relentless effort in delivering projects, ensuring my full commitment to every task while continuously growing as a professional."
